# SpeechArduino
Speech recognition with an Arduino Nano.

These are the source files associated with the Instructable here

https://www.instructables.com/Speech-Recognition-With-an-Arduino-Nano

Or search www.instructables.com for "Speech Recognition Arduino"

The latest versions of the files will be in the Instructable. The versions here may have been superseded.

However, Instructables does not allow uploading of EXE files, hence these files are here

  SpeechLearn1.exe
  test2.txt
  train2raw.txt

You should refer to the Instructable to find how to use these files.

Just in case the Instructable is unavailable, I have included the source documents that I used in writing it. These source documents may also have been superseded.
